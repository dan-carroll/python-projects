# [Python Projects](https://github.com/dan-carroll/python-projects)

Python projects from books, tutorials, and my own imagination.

## Personal Projects

- ### [Dan Carroll on Pythonanywhere](https://dancarroll.pythonanywhere.com/)

First off, I have a website hosted on [Pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) that is purely Python. Operating under Python version 3.6 running on [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/), the Python web framework. A micro framework such as this allows for finer control of the web interface. It is a very interesting way to setup a web site.

## Projects from Books

Surprisingly, many programming books are available in some formats for free online.
